a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be,good player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
in short this player is good at size value hardware design but really bad at its software,good player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the ipod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay 300 for this great player,great player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
all in all this a great player that blows the ipod away with easy to use and understand features software that is simple to understand and use and a great sound which is all that matters in a mp3 player ,great player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB

i have had it for about 2 weeks and its the best player i have seen and used ever,best player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
on the subject of headphones this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof,normal player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player,previous player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation but its a very user friendly player i am going to,friendly player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with bass boost,simple player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software,mediocre player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best,overall player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
considering the price and specs this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player,large player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
this is an excellent player especially for the price with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod,excellent player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic,fantastic mp3 player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
the player is fast and sounds great it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music or making it sound like you are hearing the music in a huge auditorium,fast player,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
first ill start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good,good players,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
its really a shame because otherwise creative mp3 players are very good and have the best sound quality of any players on the market,good mp3 players,good player,26,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
zennxs replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod,replaceable battery,replaceable battery,13,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB

the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources you cannot do this on the ipod except for a cumbersome workaround using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ,hard drive,hard drive,13,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
4 the zen stores data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ,hard drive,hard drive,13,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be at best a 40gb portable hard drive albeit one on which i cannot create folders or at worst a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ,hard drive,hard drive,13,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
i am annoyed that the players not automatically recognized as a hard drive,hard drive,hard drive,13,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB

transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad,hard disk,hard drive,13,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
the zen does not support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders documents and programs cannot be launched from the zen so it is not a hard disk its a storage device at best,hard disk,hard drive,13,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB

the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does not come in the overused blue,smaller screen,easy screen,12,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
the cons are not really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and its based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders on the pc and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did not have any that might be the same as another,big deal,big deal,10,Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB
